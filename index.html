				<!--- Introduction --->
				<section>
					<h2 class="top-header">Introduction</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Goal - Creating a theoretical tracking platform</li>
						<li>Motivation - Why design a low power tracker?</li>
						<li>
							Developing the tracker
							<ul>
								<li>Writing Code</li>
								<li>Creating PCB</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Profiling program</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						The goal of the project was to create a theoretical tracking platform, which <b>could be the bases of an actual tracker</b>.<br>
						This includes a <b>prototype</b>, as well as an <b>analysis of its performance</b>.<br>
						This platform should <b>focus on accuracy and battery-life</b>.<br><br>

						<b>---- NEXT ----</b><br>
						<b>Why do this?</b>
						There are <b>two main reasons</b>, there is a <b>need for trackers</b> and tracking techniques are <b>rarely optimized for power</b>, but accuracy.<br>
						This leads to an interesting <b>analysis</b> with a trade-off between <b>accuracy and power</b>, which is rarely discussed.<br><br>

						<b>---- NEXT ----</b><br>
						<b>Creating the tracker</b> consists of two parts, <b>writing the code</b> for it and <b>creating the PCB</b>.<br>
						We will <b>only discuss writing the code</b>, as <b>PCB design</b> is <b>not part</b> of the project.<br><br>

						<b>---- NEXT ----</b><br>
						Finally, we want to <b>create a program</b>, which can be used <b>to profile</b> the <b>power consumption</b> of the project.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<!--- Requirements --->
				<section>
					<h2 class="top-header">Requirements</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Tracking accuracy: 50m</li>
						<li>Battery-lifetime: 10 years</li>
						<li>Communication range: 10km</li>
						<li>Simple visualization of power consumption</li>
						<li>Optimization parameters
							<ol>
								<li>Range of communication</li>
								<li>Power consumption</li>
								<li>Modularity</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						The requirements of the project are.<br><br>

						First, <b>the accuracy</b> of the tracker should be <b>within 50m</b>.<br>
						This was chosen as you would be able to <b>get a general idea of where the device is.</b><br><br>

						It should be able to keep running for at least <b>10 years on a single CR2032 battery</b>.<br>
						10 years was chosen, as this is the <b>target of most LPWAN</b> devices.<br><br>

						It should be able to <b>connect to the network</b> from at least <b>10km away.</b><br>
						This was chosen, as it would allow for <b>better coverage.</b><br><br>

						We should be able to get a <b>simple overview</b> of the <b>power consumption</b> of the system.<br>
						This would aid us in <b>reducing the power consumption.</b><br><br>

						We also want to <b>optimize the project</b> for different parameters, these are <b>range, power consumption, and modularity.</b><br>
						This should be the <b>order of importance</b> when <b>selecting components</b> and <b>writing the code.</b><br><br>

						The reason <b>range is above power consumption</b> is that we want <b>good coverage</b>, otherwise short range networks would be better.

				<!--- Picking Components --->
				<section>
					<h2 class="top-header">Picking Components</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Needed components:
							<ol>
								<li>MCU</li>
								<li>Communication</li>
								<li>Tracker</li>
							</ol></li>
						<li>STM32</li>
						<li>LR1110</li>
						<li>BC660K-GL</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<b>Three components are needed</b>, an <b>MCU</b>, a <b>communication device</b> and a <b>tracking device.</b><br><br>

						Based on trying to <b>optimize for power consumption</b> in <b>both running and sleep mode</b>, we chose to go with the STM32 line, specifically the <b>STM32U0 and STM32U3.</b><br><br>

						Then, to communicate over LoRa, we chose the LR1110, which will also be used for tracking, as it contains a WiFi and GNSS receiver.
						Because of this, we need to always have the LR1110 on the project, to get it to work.<br><br>

						Finally, we have the BC660K-GL, which we use for NB communication.

				<!--- Program Implementation --->
				<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id="1">
					<h2 class="top-header">Program Implementation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Program parts
							<ol>
								<li>Initialization</li>
								<li>Join network</li>
								<li>Scan location</li>
								<li>Send data</li>
								<li>Exit</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Program flow using #define</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						The program consists of 5 main parts: Initialization, Join network, Scanning location, Send data, and exit.<br><br>

						<b>---- NEXT ----</b><br>
						Each part of the code does a specific task.
						This task will change based on what we want to program to do.
						To do this we use defines to mask out specific parts of the code at compile time.
						This allows for more efficient execution compared to using normal if-statements, as masking out the code will not create any additional code.
					</aside>

				<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id="1">

					<h3>Initialization</h3>
					<div style="width: 50%; float: left;">
						<ol>
							<li>Reset LR1110</li>
							<li>Resume LR1110 communication</li>
							<li>Initialize BC660K-GL</li>

					</div>
					<div style="width: 50%; float: left">
						<img src="images/tracker-flowchart-init.svg" width="40%">
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						Initialization handles setting up the LR1110 and BC660K-GL.
						Based on the settings, this includes resetting the LR1110, resuming its radio communication, connecting the BC660K-GL to NB, and initializing the LR1110.

						</ul>
					</div>
					<div style="width: 50%; float: left">
						<img src="images/tracker-flowchart-join.svg" width="100%">
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						Joining the network is split into two paths: Joining LoRa or connecting to MQTT.
						The LoRa part does not guarantee that we are connected, this is checked later on.
						This allows us to initiate the scanning without having to wait for a response.

					<h3>Scan Location</h3>

							<li>Scan GNSS</li>
							<li>Wait for WiFi</li>
							<li>Wait for GNSS</li>

					</div>
					<div style="width: 50%; float: left">
						<img src="images/tracker-flowchart-location.svg" width="90%">
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						Location scanning can be done with WiFi or GNSS.
						First we initiate the scanning, then we wait for a response.
						The GNSS scanning might return that there are no satellites, if this happens, we scan and wait again.<br><br>

						This is not split into two paths, as we allow both WiFi and GNSS scanning.

					<h3>Send Data - LoRa</h3>
					<div style="width: 50%; float: left;">
						<ol>
							<li>Wait for connection</li>
							<li>Try to send data</li>
							<li>If data transmission failed, rejoin network</li>

					<div style="width: 50%; float: left">
						<img src="images/tracker-flowchart-send-lora.svg" width="80%">
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						We then send the scanned data.
						This is done over LoRa or NB.<br><br>

						For LoRa we first check if we have joined the network, if it failed, we try again until we succeed.
						We then try to send the data, first we check how many times we have failed at sending the data, if this is greater than our counter, we leave the network and rejoin.
						We then send the WiFi or GNSS data.
						If we failed, then we try again from the beginning, otherwise we continue.<br><br>

						This loop is created to harden the code, as we noticed when testing the system, it might sometimes be unable to send the data, at which point re-joining the network helped.

						</ol>
					</div>
					<div style="width: 50%; float: left">
						<img src="images/tracker-flowchart-send-mqtt.svg" width="60%">
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						Sending the data over NB is simply done by publishing the results to MQTT.
						All error handling is done in the send function, because of how we communicate with the BC660K-GL.

					<h3>Exit</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						The final part of the code exits the LoRa network and suspends the modem right before we sleep.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id="1">
					<h2 class="top-header">Program Implementation</h2>
					<h3>Sleep</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Different sleep modes used different places:
							<ol>
								<li>Waiting for LR1110 communication</li>
								<li>Sleeping at the end after execution is done</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						There are two part of the code where we sleep, at the end and when waiting for the LR1110 to communicate.<br><br>

						<b>---- NEXT ----</b><br>
						Waiting for the LR1110 should keep the program counter valid, which means we have to retain RAM and registers.
						Because of this, we can only enter XXX sleep.<br><br>

						<b>---- NEXT ----</b><br>
						The final sleep should consume the least amount of power, therefor XXX sleep mode is used.
						This also has the effect of clearing RAM and resetting the program, thus we do not have to free any pointers or create an infinite while loop.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<!--- Profiling Code --->
				<section>
					<h2 class="top-header">Profiling Code</h2>
					<img src="/images/profiling-program.svg" width="90%">

					<aside class="notes">
						One of the requirements was to easily profile code and find which parts of the code consume the most power.
						To do this, we created a program, which can take the measurements and code, and display the charge consumption per line.<br><br>

						This means we would first need to convert the code into specific sections.
						Then we need to convert the measurements into the consumption for each of these sections.
						We use two different scripts for this, one for converting code and the other for collecting measurements.
						Then a separate script was created, which could display these as the background color of the code.<br><br>

						The colors represent the fraction of how much a line takes to execute compared to the total charge consumed.
						This fraction is then gamma corrected, to make small differences in the not-so power consuming section be more visible.<br><br>

						The user can also highlight a line of code to get the charge consumed at that line at the bottom of the window.

						If we collect the data, we can see that the GPS is generally more accurate than the WiFi scanning.<br><br>

						This graph represents the error of each of the measurements, for WiFi and GPS, in meters.
						The graph is logarithmic on the y-axis to compress the data better.
						Increasing the accuracy means decreasing the distance, and thus the lower the bar the better.<br><br>

						The one measurement from the forest is indeed very inaccurate for the GPS, however the WiFi is just not there.<br><br>
						
						From this, we see that the best places to use WiFi scanning is places with a lot of access points and roads nearby, this is usually indoors.
						For GPS, the data seems to be affected a lot by direct coverage by foliage or roof and how close you are to buildings.

					<aside class="notes">
						Because we did not have a pull-up resistor on NSS, we were unable to measure the average current consumption on the PCB.
						Therefor we calculated the maximal charge consumed by the LR1110 and the MCU in low power mode.
						This gave us an estimate of the average power consumption, which is around 1.616uA.<br><br>

						We also need the execution time of our program, which is around 29.2s.<br><br>

						Then we can calculate the average current consumption needed to achieve a 10 year battery life, that being 2.566uA.

						On the charge consumption, we can see that compiler flags seem to have no real effect, with the exception of using -O1.
						Since this is counterintuitive, more measurements would be needed before a definitive answer can be given.
						Some explanations would be that greater optimizations would make some parts of the code too fast, which means we would need to wait for the LR1110 more.
						The other explanation would be that optimization flags do not care about power, only execution time, since some flags might change the code to use more energy intensive instructions, this could increase the power consumed.<br><br>

						Adding a PU on NSS increases the average current consumption when sleeping, however this is due to the LR1110 now periodically sending and receiving messages while the MCU sleeps.
						We can combine this with leaving the network before sleeping, which removes this, and we can therefor see a great decrease in average charge consumed.
						This does not affect the charge consumed when running at all.<br><br>

						We also found that not waiting for a response from the LoRa network, would decrease the charge consumed, this is due to us no longer receiving the first acknowledge from the server.<br><br>

						Finally, we found out that the optimal frequency for the MCU CPU was around 524kHz.
						At this frequency, we execute the code fast enough for the LR1110 to not be wasting time unnecessarily, without wasting power more than necessary when sleeping.

					<aside class="notes">
						Looking at the supply voltage graph, we see that reducing the voltage from 3.3V to 2.5V gives a noticeable decrease in charge consumed.
						This effect was not noticed as much when not waiting for RX response, which is probably due to it not being able to receive any packages.<br><br>

						We were also unable to measure the sleep current on the final PCB, as we did not have a PU on the NSS pin.
						This means the results are not as accurate as they do not account for all other components and swings in the current consumption.<br><br>

						From the estimated battery lifetime, we found that a sleep period of about 4 days would be needed, this is a little longer than what could be considered useable.
						We could add more batteries to reduce this period, with 4 batteries reducing it down to 1 day between executions.
						If a shorter period is needed, and we do not want to add additional batteries, then we would have to live with a shorter battery lifetime.

						To help with optimizing the power consumption, we were able to create a program, which can visualize the charge consumed at each line.
						This program was successfully deployed and significant optimizations were made.<br><br>

						The tracker was able to communicate over protocols, which in theory should support up to 10km range.
						This was not experimentally concluded however.
